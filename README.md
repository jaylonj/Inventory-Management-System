# Inventory Management System
A mock inventory management system, written in Java, that would allow a business to keep track of parts and the products that are composed of the parts. 
I manage and visualize the inventory system through the JavaFX GUI toolkit and reinforce the integrity of the system records by appropriately rejecting the deletion of parts associated with a product.
